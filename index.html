        <p>
          Hi, I would like to begin by thanking you for taking the time to visit
          my website. I know there are countless links floating around that you
          could have searched or navigated to, so it means a lot that you ended
          up on mine. While exploring the different sections, I hope you enjoy
          the content you find and get the chance to learn more about me from a
          personal and development stance. Providing a quick overview, I am
          currently a Computer Science major residing in College Station, TX
          attending Texas A&M University. I have been in software development
          for a few years now and have gotten to experience a wide breadth of
          technologies. Software development has provided me with a great merger
          between enjoyment and professionalism. I never thought that I would be
          able to appreciate the work I do in both academia and my personal life
          as much as I do today. When I was very young I always had a deep
          interest in technology, whether it was something as simple as a new
          video game being released or building PCs in middle school. That
          slowly built up into exploring deeper technology such as Linux and
          introductory programming. I wasn't exposed to full-scale software
          development until later in life, but I am immensely happy with how
          everything has turned out to this point. Going past software
          development, some of the activities I do day-to-day include biking,
          graphic design, and music. As much as I do love programming, I believe
          you have to spread out your experience to become not only become a
          better developer but develop a better view on life as well. I do not
          want to dive into too deep details regarding my technical skills or
          career-oriented goals as I explore these topics in my other sections.
          Please feel free to explore through the pages and contact me if you
          have any questions.
