        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Since you made it this far, I was hoping to share a little bit about
          myself. To keep it slightly interesting, I am going to tackle my
          hobbies and interest at a quick and high level. The main hobbie I
          currently have is tennis. I have been involved in it since around 13
          years old and have always tried to keep it up. My next hobby is wake
          surfing. This is more of a hobby I have back home, but I try to go
          back as much as I can. Outside of my hobbies I have a regular family
          size with 1 brother. I also have a dog that lives with me down in
          College Station. He is a Golden Retriever named Milo. He is around 3
          years old and has been a great addition to my life down here. Moving
          past my normal life, my academic and professional life has been going
          well so far. My current interest in computer science mainly center
          around full stack web development. I have been starting to develop
          more of an interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning,
          but pursueing a career in those fields is still far off. Going back to
          full-stack, this summer I am planning on starting a full time job in
          Dallas. I am not sure on my team details yet, but I am hoping for the
          best. The company has been held in high standards by peers in computer
          science, so I think it will be a great fit.
